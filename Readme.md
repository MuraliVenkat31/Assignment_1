# Data-Scraping-with-Selenium-Streamlit

# Introduction
## Data Scraping with Selenium

    Selenium is an open-source tool used for automating web browsers. 
It's commonly used for web scraping, which involves extracting data from websites. 
Selenium allows you to interact with websites as a user would, navigating pages, clicking buttons, and filling out forms.

## Dynamic Filtering using Streamlit
  
    Streamlit is an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science. 
It allows you to create interactive web apps with minimal code. 
Dynamic filtering involves updating the data displayed in the app based on user input, such as selecting a filter option.

## Combining Selenium and Streamlit
### By combining Selenium and Streamlit, you can create a web app that:
    1. Scrapes data from a website using Selenium
    2. Displays the data in the app using Streamlit
    3. Allows users to dynamically filter the data using Streamlit's interactive elements

## Example Use Case
    Suppose you want to scrape job listings from a website and allow users to filter by location, 
job title, and company. You can use Selenium to scrape the data and 
Streamlit to create an interactive app that displays the data and allows users to apply filters.

## Benefits
    1. Automated data extraction: Selenium automates the process of extracting data from websites.
    2. Interactive filtering: Streamlit allows users to interactively filter the data, making it easier to find relevant information.
    3. Real-time updates: Streamlit updates the data in real-time as users apply filters.

## Code Structure

    1. Selenium script to scrape data from the website
    2. Streamlit app to display the data and allow user input
    3. Integration code to connect the Selenium script to the Streamlit app

## Conclusion

    Combining Selenium and Streamlit enables you to create powerful web apps that automate data extraction and 
provide interactive filtering capabilities. This allows users to easily find relevant information and 
makes it easier to maintain and update the app.
